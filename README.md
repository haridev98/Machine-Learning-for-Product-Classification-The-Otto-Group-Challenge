## Introduction : Product classifcation

<p>The Otto Group is one of the world's biggest e-commerce companies, with subsidiaries in more than 20 countries. They sell millions of products worldwide every day, with several thousand products being added to their product line.</p>

<p>A consistent analysis of the performance of their products is crucial for the Otto Group. However, due to their diverse global infrastructure, many identical products get classified differently. This makes it difficult to accurately track the performance of their products and generate insights about their product range.</p>


### Business Problem

<p>The Otto Group is looking to use machine learning to improve the accuracy of their product classification. They have a dataset of 93 features for more than 200,000 products. The objective of the Otto Group Product Classification Challenge is to build a predictive model that can distinguish between their main product categories.</p>
